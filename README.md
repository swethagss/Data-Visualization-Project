# Motor Vehicle Collisions - Data Visualization and EDA

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of motor vehicle collision data to understand patterns, trends, and insights related to accidents. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques, this project uncovers important factors contributing to traffic accidents, such as time of day, location, weather conditions, and types of vehicles involved.

By visualizing the data, we aim to provide a clearer understanding of the collision statistics, identify potential risk factors, and assist in improving traffic safety measures.

## Introduction

Motor vehicle collisions have a significant impact on public health, safety, and the economy. Understanding the patterns and causes of these accidents can play a crucial role in preventing future incidents. This project explores collision data to identify key trends and visualizes the results using different charts and plots. The ultimate goal is to offer valuable insights that could be used by traffic authorities, urban planners, and insurance companies to minimize risks and improve safety measures.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about motor vehicle collisions. It includes the following key features:

- **Collision ID**: A unique identifier for each collision.
- **Date and Time**: When the collision occurred.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the accident.
- **Weather Conditions**: Weather at the time of the accident.
- **Contributing Factors**: Causes of the collision (e.g., distracted driving, speeding).
- **Vehicle Type**: Type of vehicles involved in the collision.
- **Injuries/Deaths**: Number of people injured or killed in the collision.

## Data Preprocessing

Before diving into the analysis, we need to preprocess the data to ensure it is clean and ready for visualization:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Identifying and filling or removing missing values in key columns.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting date-time columns into usable formats, extracting relevant features like year, month, and day.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Converting categorical variables like weather conditions and contributing factors into numerical representations for further analysis.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers that may skew the results.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this phase, we explore the data visually and statistically to uncover important trends:

1. **Collision Frequency by Time**: Visualizing the number of accidents over time, segmented by hour, day of the week, month, and year. This will help identify peak times for collisions.
2. **Collisions by Location**: Geospatial visualization using maps to identify accident hotspots.
3. **Weather and Accident Correlation**: Analyzing how different weather conditions impact the frequency of accidents.
4. **Accidents by Vehicle Type**: Examining the types of vehicles involved in collisions and how they relate to accident severity.
5. **Contributing Factors**: Identifying and visualizing the most common causes of collisions.

## Key Findings

Based on the EDA, some important trends and insights may include:

- The most common times and locations for collisions.
- The influence of weather conditions on accident rates.
- The relationship between certain contributing factors (e.g., distracted driving, speeding) and accident severity.
- Potential correlations between vehicle types and the likelihood of injury or death.

## Conclusion

By visualizing and analyzing the motor vehicle collision data, we are able to derive valuable insights that can help mitigate the risks associated with accidents. Traffic authorities can use these findings to implement targeted safety measures, while urban planners can make data-driven decisions to improve road infrastructure.

## Future Work

- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop machine learning models to predict future accidents based on historical data and influencing factors.
- **Real-time Data Analysis**: Implement real-time collision detection and prevention strategies.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore collision data on the go.
